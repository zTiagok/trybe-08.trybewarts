  <br>
  <span> After learning how to make a form, we ended up applying its concepts to this project. A themed web form, based on the magical world of Harry Potter and the four houses of Hogwarts.
 </span> 
  <br><br>
    <span> That's our first duo project! </span>
  <br><br>
  <span> Enter your information, such as name, family, what content you most want to learn, and even your favorite house! And don't forget to leave a comment at the bottom of the form. </span>
